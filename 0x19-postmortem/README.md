Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Project Outage
Issue Summary
Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 1:15 PM EST on November 15, 2023.
Impact: A critical web service was down, affecting the user login system. Approximately 60% of users experienced timeouts and failed login attempts.
Root Cause: The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer, which led to an uneven distribution of traffic to a single server, causing it to overload and fail.
Timeline
10:00 AM - Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating high response time.
10:05 AM - The engineering team was alerted. Initial assumption was a DDoS attack.
10:20 AM - Network traffic analysis ruled out DDoS. Focus shifted to internal server issues.
10:45 AM - Misleading path: Investigated database server performance, but no issues found.
11:30 AM - Incident escalated to the infrastructure team.
12:00 PM - Discovered load balancer misconfiguration.
1:00 PM - Load balancer reconfigured and restarted.
1:15 PM - Service restored and monitoring confirmed normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The core issue was traced to the load balancer, which had an incorrect setting. This caused it to route a majority of traffic to one server, leading to its overload. The other servers in the pool were underutilized, creating a bottleneck.
Resolution: The load balancer configuration was corrected to ensure even traffic distribution. The affected server was restarted to clear the backlog of requests. Post-fix, all servers showed normal load and performance levels.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Enhanced monitoring on load balancers.
Regular audits of load balancer configurations.
Improved alerting for server overloads.
Tasks to Address Issue:
Task 1: Implement a new monitoring system to detect uneven load distribution across servers.
Task 2: Schedule quarterly audits of load balancer configurations.
Task 3: Develop an automated response system for high load alerts.
Task 4: Conduct training for the engineering team on identifying and responding to similar issues.
Task 5: Review and update the incident response protocol to include specific steps for load balancer-related issues.
In conclusion, this incident highlighted the importance of accurate system configurations and the need for robust monitoring. The corrective actions and preventative measures outlined above are aimed at preventing a recurrence and ensuring the reliability of our services.
